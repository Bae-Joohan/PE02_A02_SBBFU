<p>About the project <p>

```We aim to develop Python-based data analysis software
The goal is to develop software that can analyze wafer scale data in detail.

At first,

The main task is to receive data from the customer and then receive the request.
Main request -Lot
             -Wafer
             -Die row & colum
We can analyze the selected data by specifying specific elements    
In order to develop such analysis software, a black box(software) that implments this function is created to solve the customer's request.

In the software,
We process the raw data and print it out. We show the processed data as a 2*3 figure and save the file. In addition, it creates an Excel csv file that can analyze varous xml files as a result file and makes a dataframe that can be compared simply.

Finally, the final report The final goal is to make documentation about the tasks we did using a jupyter notebook and report it to the customer.

Please put the data in the 'Data' folder
specify the file path
Run the Run.py
```
